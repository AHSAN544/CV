    <p><font size = "4"><em><strong>Introduction:</strong> <br><strong>ALLAH ALMIGHTY</strong> is the supreme deity in Islam,<br> 
        recognized as the singular, omnipotent, and omniscient God. <br>
        The term "Allah" is derived from the Arabic language and <br>
        translates directly to "The God," indicating monotheism's <br>
        core tenet within the Islamic faith. Allah is revered as <br>
        the Creator, Sustainer, and Judge of the universe.</em></font></p>
        <h3>Attributes of ALLAH</h3>
        <p><font size = "4"><em><strong>Oneness (Tawhid):</strong> <br>Central to Islamic belief is the concept of Tawhid, <br>
            which emphasizes Allah's indivisible and unique nature. There is no <br>
            deity worthy of worship except Allah, and this forms the foundation <br> 
            of the Muslim declaration of faith, the Shahada.</em></font></p>
        <p><font size = "4"><em><strong>Omnipotence and Omniscience:</strong> <br>
             Allah is all-powerful (Al-Qadir) and all -knowing (Al-Alim). <br>
             These attributes signify that nothing occurs without <br> 
            Allah's will, and He possesses complete knowledge of all things, past, <br>
            present, and future.</em></font></p>
        <p><font size = "4"><em><strong>Mercy and Compassion:</strong> <br>
            Among the most frequently invoked names of Allah are Ar-Rahman <br>
            (The Most Merciful) and Ar-Rahim (The Most Compassionate). <br>
            These attributes are a testament to Allah's infinite mercy <br>
            and kindness towards His creation.</em></font></p>
        <p><font size = "4"><em><strong>Justice and Wisdom:</strong> <br>
            Allah is also described as Al-Adl (The Just) and Al-Hakim (The Wise).<br>
            He administers justice fairly and acts with perfect wisdom, ensuring <br>
            that every action and event in the universe has a purpose and is part of His divine plan. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Transcendence and Immanence:</strong> <br>
            While Allah is transcendent, beyond all physical limitations and <br>
            human comprehension (Al-Mutakabbir), He is also immanent, closer <br>
            to the believers than their jugular vein (Quran 50:16). This duality <br>
            reflects His presence and accessibility in the lives of Muslims.</em></font></p>
